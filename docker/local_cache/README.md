# Local Cache for the Docker Container

This directory contains local cache files that are used by the running docker
container for this project. This file should (`README.md`) should not be
deleted, but it is safe to delete any of the other files or subdirectories in
this directory at any time without breaking anything. The only difference this
will make is that the next time you use the ROI-drawing tool, it might have to
re-download whatever you deleted. The primary purpose of using this directory is
to speed up the display of images when you return to the tool and look at or
edit subjects you have already looked at.
